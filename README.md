# Test-automation-portfolio
Portfolio of my Test automation projects in, Java, and Appium
This project has a basic test to open Instagram website on an Android device using Appium and Chrome browser.

# What it does

- Opens Instagram website (`https://www.instagram.com/`)
- Checks if the page loaded by looking for the `<body>` element
- Closes the browser

# Notes

- The test uses a simple XPath (`//body`) because the phone was not connected during development.
