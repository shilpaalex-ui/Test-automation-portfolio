# Test-automation-portfolio
Portfolio of my Test automation projects in, Java, TestNG and Appium
This project has a basic test to open Instagram app.

# What it does

- Opens Instagram app.
- Checks if the page loaded by looking for the  element
- Closes the browser

# Notes

- The test uses a simple XPath (`//body`) because the phone was not connected during development.
